# SQL-EDA-project

This project demonstrates my process of exploring and analyzing a dataset using SQL. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to understand the dimensions and measures within a dataset.

**Processes Performed With Project**
There are 14 scripts #0-13

00. The initial creation of the database
01. Exploration of the database - List all tables and columns for a table.
02. Exploration of the dimensions - Exploring the countries of customers and product information.
03. Exploration of the date range - Determining total duration in months of data and customer ages.
04. Exploration of the measures - Using aggregated metrics for quick insights.
05. Magnitude Analysis - quantify data, group results, and gain an understanding of distribution across categories.
06. Ranking Analysis - ranking items based on performance and identifying top performers and stragglers.
07. Change Over Time Analysis - Analyzing sales performance over time.
08. Cumulative Analysis - calculating running totals, moving averages, and tracking performance over time.
09. Performance Analysis - measuring the performance of products and year-over-year analysis.
10. Data Segmentation - segmenting products by cost range and grouping customers based on spending behavior.
11. Part to Whole Analysis - Categories' contribution to sales and the categories with the fewest orders.
12. Customer Report - Creates a new view to be run as a report (SELECT * FROM gold.report_customers) for in-depth analysis of customer aggregations, average order value, and average monthly spend.
13. Products Report - Creates a new view to be run as a report (SELECT * FROM gold.report_products) for in-depth analysis of product aggregations, totals, and averages.
